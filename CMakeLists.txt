 # @section DESCRIPTION
 #
 # ISAAC
 #
 # "The son of Samu is Isaac." The project called Isaac is a case study 
 # of using deep Q learning with neural networks for predicting the next 
 # sentence of a conversation.
 # 
 # SAMU
 #
 # The main purpose of this project is to allow the evaluation and 
 # verification of the results of the paper entitled "A disembodied 
 # developmental robotic agent called Samu Bátfai". It is our hope 
 # that Samu will be the ancestor of developmental robotics chatter 
 # bots that will be able to chat in natural language like humans do.
